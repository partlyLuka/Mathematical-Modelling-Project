# Mathematical Modelling Project
In this project, I was given 2 disctinct points in the plane $T_1(x_1, y_1)$, $T_2(x_2, y_2)$ with $x_1 < x_2$ and $y_1 > y_2$. I had to find the 3rd degree polynomial, such that it interpolates the points
$T_1$, $T_2$ and $\frac{1}{2}(T_1 + T_2$ and it must be such that the time it takes for a ball to travel along its graph from point $T_1$ to point $T_2$ shall be minimal. 

The code is in Matlab, the solutions to the problem is in the SOlution.pdf file.
